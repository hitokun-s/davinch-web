# Background

There are 2 types of guidance for museum visitor.

1. group guidance, group tour
2. personal headset guidance system

# Problem

We cannot ask questions so actively and personally.  
As for tour, we must consider others, and cannot ask enough.  
As for headset guidance, we should be very passive.  

But actually,visitors want to ask many questions in heart (at least I want!).    

# Solution

Today the world is under interaction between several smart assistants.  
We can classify them to 3 types:  
 
1. General assistant based on general knowledge(ex. Siri, Watson)
2. Specialized assistant based on specific domain(ex. Watson for medical)
3. Personal assistant(ex. interaction between Google calendar, Gmail, Google map for your schedule)

For future museum, we can think about smart curator as type 2, or hybrid system.  
Such assistant should be able to :  

- access all of data about art, artist, history, museum, or anything else if needed as curator
- understand user( = musuem visitor) local context(ex, where the visitor is in a musuem, what the visitor is looking at now)
- answer any question from visitor, ideally as voice-to-voice communication
